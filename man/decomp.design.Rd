\description{
This function performs a design-based decomposition of Cochran's Q
for assessing the homogeneity in the whole network, the homogeneity
within designs, and the homogeneity/consistency between designs. It
allows also an assessment of the consistency assumption after
detaching the effect of single designs.
}
\details{
In the context of network meta-analysis and the assessment of the
homogeneity and consistency assumption, a generalized Cochran's Q
statistic for multivariate meta-analysis can be used as shown in
Krahn et al. (2013). This Q statistic can be decomposed in a sum
of within-design Q statistics and one between-designs Q statistic
that incorporates the concept of design inconsistency, see Higgins
et al. (2012).

For assessing the inconsistency in a random effects model, the
between-designs Q statistic can be calculated based on a full
design-by-treatment interaction random effects model (see Higgins
et al., 2012). This Q statistic will be automatically given in the
output (\eqn{\tau^2} estimated by the method of moments (see Jackson
et al., 2012). Alternatively, the square-root of the between-study
variance can be prespecified by argument \code{tau.preset} to
obtain a between-designs Q statistic (in \code{Q.inc.random}), its
design-specific contributions \code{Q.inc.design.random.preset}) as
well as residuals after detaching of single designs
(\code{residuals.inc.detach.random.preset}).

Since an inconsistent treatment effect of one design can
simultaneously inflate several residuals, Krahn et al. (2013)
suggest for locating the inconsistency in a network to fit a set of
extended models allowing for example for a deviating effect of each
study design in turn. The recalculated between-designs Q statistics
are given in list component \code{Q.inc.detach}. The change of the
inconsistency contribution of single designs can be investigated in
more detail by a net heat plot (see function
\link{netheat}). Designs where only one treatment is involved in
other designs of the network or where the removal of corresponding
studies would lead to a splitting of the network do not contribute
to the inconsistency assessment. These designs are not included in
\code{Q.inc.detach}.
