\description{
Provides four models for the network meta-analysis of binary data
(Mantel-Haenszel method, based on the non-central hypergeometric
distribution, penalised logistic regression, and the
inverse variance method).
}
\details{
This function implements four models for the network meta-analysis
of binary data:
\itemize{
\item The Mantel-Haenszel network meta-analysis model, as described
  in Efthimiou et al. (2019) (\code{method = "MH"});
\item a network meta-analysis model using the non-central
  hypergeometric distribution with the Breslow approximation, as
  described in Stijnen et al. (2010) (\code{method = "NCH"});
\item a logistic regression with penalised likelihood, as described
  in Evrenoglou et al. (2022) (\code{method = "LRP"});
\item the inverse variance method for network meta-analysis
  (\code{method = "Inverse"}), also provided by
  \code{\link{netmeta}}.
}

Comparisons belonging to multi-arm studies are identified by
identical study labels (argument \code{studlab}). It is therefore
important to use identical study labels for all comparisons
belonging to the same multi-arm study.

Data entry for this function is in \emph{contrast-based} format,
that is, each line of the data corresponds to a single pairwise
comparison between two treatments (arguments \code{treat1},
\code{treat2}, \code{event1}, \code{n1}, \code{event2}, and
\code{n2}). If data are provided in \emph{arm-based} format, that
is, number of events and participants are given for each treatment
arm separately, function \code{\link[meta]{pairwise}} can be used to
transform the data to \emph{contrast-based} format (see help page
of function \code{\link[meta]{pairwise}}).

Note, all pairwise comparisons must be provided for a multi-arm
study. Consider a multi-arm study of \emph{p} treatments with known
variances. For this study, the number of events and observations
must be provided for each treatment, for each of \emph{p}(\emph{p}
- 1) / 2 possible comparisons in separate lines in the data. For
instance, a three-arm study contributes three pairwise comparisons,
a four-arm study even six pairwise comparisons. Function
\code{\link[meta]{pairwise}} automatically calculates all pairwise
comparisons for multi-arm studies.

For \code{method = "Inverse"}, both common and random effects
models are calculated regardless of values choosen for arguments
\code{common} and \code{random}. Accordingly, the network estimates
for the random effects model can be extracted from component
\code{TE.random} of an object of class \code{"netmeta"} even if
argument \code{random = FALSE}.  However, all functions in R
package \bold{netmeta} will adequately consider the values for
\code{common} and \code{random}. E.g. function
\code{\link{print.summary.netmeta}} will not print results for the
random effects model if \code{random = FALSE}.

For the random-effects model, the direct treatment estimates are
based on the common between-study variance \eqn{\tau^2} from the
network meta-analysis.

For \code{method = "MH"} and \code{method = "NCH"}, only a common
effects model is available.

By default, treatment names are not abbreviated in
printouts. However, in order to get more concise printouts,
argument \code{nchar.trts} can be used to define the minimum number
of characters for abbreviated treatment names (see
\code{\link{abbreviate}}, argument \code{minlength}). R function
\code{\link{treats}} is utilised internally to create abbreviated
treatment names.

Names of treatment comparisons are created by concatenating
treatment labels of pairwise comparisons using \code{sep.trts} as
separator (see \code{\link{paste}}). These comparison names are
used in the covariance matrices \code{Cov.common} and
\code{Cov.random} and in some R functions, e.g,
\code{\link{decomp.design}}. By default, a colon is used as the
separator. If any treatment label contains a colon the following
characters are used as separator (in consecutive order):
\code{"-"}, \code{"_"}, \code{"/"}, \code{"+"}, \code{"."},
\code{"|"}, and \code{"*"}. If all of these characters are used in
treatment labels, a corresponding error message is printed asking
the user to specify a different separator.
