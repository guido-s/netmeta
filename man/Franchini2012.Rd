\description{
Network meta-analysis comparing the effects of a number of
treatments for Parkinson's disease.

The data are the mean lost work-time reduction in patients given
dopamine agonists as adjunct therapy in Parkinsonâ€™s disease
(Franchini et al. 2012). The data are given as sample size, mean
and standard deviation in each trial arm. Treatments are placebo
and four active drugs. These data are used as an example in the
supplemental material of Dias et al. (2013) where placebo is coded
as 1 and the four active drugs as 2 to 5.
