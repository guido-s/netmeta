\description{
This function generates a scatter plot or biplot of P-scores with
an overlay describing partial order of treatment ranks.
}
\details{
By default (arguments \code{plottype = "scatter"} and \code{dim =
"2d"}), a scatter plot is created showing P-scores (see
\code{\link{netrank}}) for the first two outcomes considered in the
generation of a partially ordered set of treatment ranks (using
\code{\link{netposet}}). In addition to the P-scores, the partially
order of treatment ranks is shown as lines connecting treatments
which is analogous to a Hasse diagram. If argument \code{dim =
"3d"}), a 3-D scatter plot is generated showing P-scores for the
first three outcomes.

To overcome the restriction of two or three dimension, a biplot
(Gabriel, 1971) can be generated using argument \code{plottype =
"biplot"}. This is essentially a scatter plot using the first two
(\code{dim = "2d"}) or three (\code{dim = "3d"}) components in a
principal components analysis (using
\code{\link[stats]{prcomp}}). Note, if only two / three outcomes
are considered in a \code{netposet} object, a 2-D / 3-D scatter
plot is generated instead of a biplot as a principal component
analysis is superfluous in such a situation.

Arguments \code{sel.x} and \code{sel.y} can be used to select
different outcomes to show on x- and y-axis in a 2-D scatter plot;
argument \code{sel.z} can be used accordingly in a 3-D scatter
plot.  These arguments are ignored for a biplot.

Note, in order to generate 3-D plots (argument \code{dim = "3d"}),
R package \bold{rgl} is necessary. Note, under macOS the X.Org X
Window System must be available (see
\url{https://www.xquartz.org}).
