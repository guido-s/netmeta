  - call metagen() with argument 'method.tau.ci = ""' to suppress

### Major changes

* In multi-arm studies, negative weights (resulting from slightly
  inconsistent standard errors) contributing less than 0.1% to the
  weight of a study are set to 0

* Separate consistency tolerances can be specified for treatment
  estimates and standard errors (which are consistent by design in
  multi-arm studies, however, can be inconsistent due to rounding of
  treatment estimates and standard errors)

* New default for consistency tolerance: 0.001 instead of 0.0005

* Print tau in addition to tau2 in outputs

* Print confidence interval for I2 in outputs

    treatment arm in networks with multi-arm studies

* netmetabin():
  - only drop single treatment arms without any events in multi-arm
    studies instead of the complete design (which is the correct
    behaviour only for two-arm studies)
  - keep the original design for multi-arm studies if a single
    treatment arm without any events has been dropped, e.g., the
    design X:Y:Z is not changed to X:Z if no events were observed in
    treatment arm Y in any multi-arm study
  - no error if argument 'event1' is not an R object created with
    pairwise() and argument 'data' is not used
  - no error in printing of network meta-analysis object if argument
    'event1' is not an R object created with pairwise()
  - calculate the correct number of patients and events for each
    treatment arm in networks with multi-arm studies

* netgraph():
  - argument 'seq' equal to "optimal" works for a single design
  - multi-arm studies are highlighted if argument 'labels' is used

    "prop.direct" in argument 'leftcols' and 'rightcols'

* discomb():
  - arguments 'reference.group' and 'baseline.reference'

  indirect evidence

* Zero treatment arm variance in multi-arm studies results in a
  warning instead of an error message

    indirect evidence

    to print (summaries of) netcomb objects

* print.decomp.design(), print.netmeta(), print.netsplit(), and
  print.summary.netmeta():

  - updated help pages for netposet() and netsplit()

### Bug fixes

* netsplit():
  - order of treatments in printouts corresponds to treatment
    comparison, e.g., "A:B" means that treatment "A" was compared
    with treatment "B" (and not the other way around).
    Side note, not sure whether this is a bug or a feature as "A:B"
    noted the design "comparison A and B" so far.

* netposet():
  - function works with a ranking matrix that contains missing
    elements, i.e., rankings that do not include all treatments

* netgraph():
  - areas for multi-arm studies are printed at the correct locations

  inconsistency are calculated according to Krahn et al. (2013);
  see help page of decomp.design()

* In printouts and forest plots, the reference treatment can be
  considered as treatment of interest or comparator (default),
  i.e., either comparisons of reference vs other treatments or
  other treatments vs reference are reported

* Tests for heterogeneity and design inconsistency are shown in
  printouts

* A biplot can be generated to show partial ordering of treatment
  rankings for more than two outcomes

    incomplete set of treatment comparisons within a study

### Major changes

* New function netleague() to print league table with network
  meta-analysis results

* pairwise():
  - zero events for binary outcomes or incidence rates are handled
    correctly in multi-arm studies by adding an increment to all
    treatment arms (in older versions of netmeta inconsistent
    treatment effects for multi-arm studies were possible as
    increments were considered in individual comparisons instead of
    all comparisons for a multi-arm study)
  - print warning and information on treatment comparisons with
    missing treatment estimate or standard error

* forest.netmeta():
  - reference group can be omitted from forest plot
  - treatments can be sorted by treatment estimate (TE), standard
    error (seTE), number of studies in direct comparison (k), and
    proportion of direct information (prop.direct)

* netmeta():

    studies and more informative error message for uncorrect number
    of comparisons in multi-arm studies due to missing treatment
    effects or standard errors in single comparisons

    labels can be specified by user (default: ":")

    size or standard error from calculation of pooled variance for
    standardized mean difference (sm = "SMD")

    arrows in scatter plot

* print.netsplit():
  - number of studies providing direct evidence printed

* netdistance():
  - argument name changed from 'A' to 'x' in order to reflect that
    input of R function can be either a netmeta object or an
    adjacency matrix

  - do not run all examples in forest.netmeta() as CRAN only allows
    a run time below 10 seconds for examples provided on a help page
  - R code to produce forest plot added to examples in dataset
    Wood2010

    comparisons containing the respecitve treatment are excluded due to
    missing values in treatment effect or standard error

    study with two treatments is available

### User-visible changes
    
* New arguments random and tau.preset in netmeasures()

* New functions netsplit() and print.netsplit()

* Consider ordering of treatments in netrank() which is defined by

    either no or only one study with two treatments is available
