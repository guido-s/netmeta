  * New function netleague() to print league table with network
    meta-analysis results

  * pairwise():
    - zero events for binary outcomes or incidence rates are handled
      correctly in multi-arm studies by adding an increment to all
      treatment arms (in older versions of netmeta inconsistent

      increments were considered in individual comparisons instead of
      all comparisons for a multi-arm study)
    - print warning and information on treatment comparisons with
      missing treatment estimate or standard error
