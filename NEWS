 ** Major changes **

  * Use roxygen2 for development of R package netmeta

  * New function plot.netrank() to produce image plot of P-scores
    
 ** Bug fixes **

  * netmeta():
    - no error if argument 'studlab' is missing
    - tackle numerical problems with zero treatment arm variances -
      actually by changes in internal function multiarm()      
    - calculate the correct number of patients and events for each
      treatment arm in networks with multi-arm studies

  * netmetabin():
    - only drop single treatment arms without any events in multi-arm
      studies instead of the complete design (which is the correct
      behaviour only for two-arm studies)
    - keep the original design for multi-arm studies if a single
      treatment arm without any events has been dropped, e.g., the
      design X:Y:Z is not changed to X:Z if no events were observed in
      treatment arm Y in any multi-arm study
    - no error if argument 'event1' is not an R object created with
      pairwise() and argument 'data' is not used
    - no error in printing of network meta-analysis object if argument
      'event1' is not an R object created with pairwise()
    - calculate the correct number of patients and events for each
      treatment arm in networks with multi-arm studies

  * netgraph():
    - argument 'seq' equal to "optimal" works for a single design
    - multi-arm studies are highlighted if argument 'labels' is used
    - comparisons defined by argument 'highlight' are marked in the
      network graph if argument 'labels' is used

  * pairwise():
    - no error if function is used without argument 'data'

 ** User-visible changes **

  * netgraph():
    - new argument 'bg.points'
    - new argument 'scale.highlight' which replaces argument
      'lwd.highlight' (which actually was ignored)
    - arguments 'col.highlight' and 'scale.highlight' can be vectors
      with same length as argument 'highlight'

  * forest.netmeta():
    - new argument 'labels' to provide treatment names - similar to
      netgraph()
    - labels set automatically for columns "pscore", "k" and
      "prop.direct" in argument 'leftcols' and 'rightcols'

 ** Internal changes **

  * multiarm():
    - use ginv() to calculate inverse of matrix Lt
    - set very small negative values in matrix W equal to zero
    - object k instead of n denotes number of treatment arms
      (same notation as Rücker & Schwarzer, 2014)

  * new auxiliary internal functions for forest plots

    warning instead of an error message

  * League tables can be exported as CSV or Excel file

    - order of treatments in printouts corresponds to treatment
      comparison, e.g., "A:B" means that treatment "A" was compared
      with treatment "B" (and not the other way around).
      Side note, not sure whether this is a bug or a feature as "A:B"
      noted the design "comparison A and B" so far.

  * Prediction intervals can be calculated for treatment estimates
    from a network meta-analysis

    see help page of decomp.design()

 ** Major changes **

  * New function netleague() to print league table with network
    meta-analysis results

  * pairwise():
    - zero events for binary outcomes or incidence rates are handled
      correctly in multi-arm studies by adding an increment to all
      treatment arms (in older versions of netmeta inconsistent
      treatment effects for multi-arm studies were possible as

    - do not run all examples in forest.netmeta() as CRAN only allows
      a run time below 10 seconds for examples provided on a help page
    - R code to produce forest plot added to examples in dataset
      Wood2010

    'reference.group' was used in netmeta()

      from fixed effect model have been used
    - netmeta() excludes a treatment from list component 'seq' if all
      comparisons containing the respecitve treatment are excluded due to
      missing values in treatment effect or standard error
    - netmeasures() does not result in an error if no or only one
      study with two treatments is available

 ** User-visible changes **

      either no or only one study with two treatments is available
