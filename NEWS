      comparison, e.g., "A:B" means that treatment "A" was compared
      with treatment "B" (and not the other way around).
      Side note, not sure whether this is a bug or a feature as "A:B"
      noted the design "comparison A and B" so far.

    - areas for multi-arm studies are printed at the correct locations
      if argument 'start.layout' is not equal to "circle" and argument
      'seq' defines a specific treatment order (this bug was
      introduced in netmeta, version 0.7-0)

    other treatments vs reference are reported

  * Tests for heterogeneity and design inconsistency are shown in
    printouts

  * A biplot can be generated to show partial ordering of treatment
    rankings for more than two outcomes

    meta-analysis results

  * pairwise():

      correctly in multi-arm studies by adding an increment to all
      treatment arms (in older versions of netmeta inconsistent

Functions netmeta and nma.ruecker:
- modified such that the estimated tau-squared in random effects model
  considers multi-arm studies

Function print.netmeta:
- information on percentage weight not printed as interpretation is
  difficult

Dataset Senn2013:
- use of unpooled standard error for each treatment comparison


2014-04-14, version 0.4-3

Function netmeta:

  'treat2')

Function print.summary.netmeta:
- print random effects estimates according to argument 'seq'

Function forest.netmeta:
- sort treatment effect estimates according to argument 'seq'

Function nma.ruecker (used internally):

  of treatment order (some treatment effects remained NA depending on
  order of treatments)


2014-03-31, version 0.4-2
